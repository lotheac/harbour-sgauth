SGAuth
======

Simple application that generates Google Authenticator TOTP passcodes, for Jolla devices that is. There is an experimental QR code scanner included that uses the viewfinder of the built in camera application to capture QR codes. This may not always work, if it fails, you can always enter the secret key manually. Accounts can be exported to other devices by scanning the account specific QR code. This QR code is visible when editing an account, if it is possible to export the account details using the otpauth uri scheme.
